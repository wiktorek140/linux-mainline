Qualcomm's LAB(LCD AMOLED Boost)/IBB(Inverting Buck Boost) Regulator

LAB can be used as a positive boost power supply and IBB can be used as a negative
boost power supply for display panels. Currently implemented for pmi8998.

Main node required properties:

- compatible:			Must be:
				"qcom,pmi8998-lab-ibb"
- #address-cells:		Must be 1
- #size-cells:			Must be 0

LAB subnode required properties:

- interrupts:			Specify the interrupts as per the interrupt
				encoding.
- interrupt-names:		Interrupt names to match up 1-to-1 with
				the interrupts specified in 'interrupts'
				property.

IBB subnode required properties:

- interrupts:			Specify the interrupts as per the interrupt
				encoding.
- interrupt-names:		Interrupt names to match up 1-to-1 with
				the interrupts specified in 'interrupts'
				property.

Example:
	pmi8998_lsid1: pmic@3 {
		labibb {
			compatible = "qcom,pmi8998-lab-ibb";
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			lab: lab {
				interrupts = <0x3 0xde 0x0 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
				interrupt-names = "lab-sc-err";
			};

			ibb: ibb {
				interrupts = <0x3 0xdc 0x2 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
				interrupt-names = "ibb-sc-err";
			};

		};
	};
